# Description
Reads out [SurfPlan](http://www.surfplan.com.au/sp/) native export, transforms the data structure, and runs an aerodynamic analysis using the [Vortex-Step-Method (VSM)](https://github.com/ocayon/Vortex-Step-Method) on your kite design.

## Installation Instructions
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jellepoland/SurfplanAdapter.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:
    ```bash
    cd SurfplanAdapter/
    ```
    
3. Create a virtual environment:
   
   Linux or Mac:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
    
    Windows:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    
4. Activate the virtual environment:

   Linux or Mac:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Windows
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

## :eyes: Usage
Inside the examples folder, the [main_run_VSM.py](examples/TUDELFT_V3_LEI_KITE/main_run_VSM.py) script is present that goes through the main steps for the [TUDELFT_V3_LEI_KITE](https://github.com/awegroup/TUDELFT_V3_LEI_KITE) SurfPlan files, in the following order.  
1. Loading the surfplan files from the data folder. 
2. Transforming the data into the appropriate format and store it inside the processed_data folder as .csv
3. Running an aerodynamic analysis using the [Vortex-Step-Method (VSM)](https://github.com/ocayon/Vortex-Step-Method)
4. Storing the outcome in the results folder.

To use this code on your kite designs from SurfPlan, one needs to:
1. Acquire the .txt and rib profiles in .dat format from the SurfPlan export menu
2. Install this code and insert the SurfPlan exported files into the data folder
3. Adjust the path inside the `main_run_VSM.py` code to where your files are stored and press run!
