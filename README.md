## :eyes: Usage

Inside the examples folder, a script is present that runs an aerodynamic analysis using the [Vortex-Step-Method](https://github.com/ocayon/Vortex-Step-Method), on your Surfplan model.

The script will (a) process the files into the desired format and store this in processed_data and (b) read out these files and run the VSM to generate plots and values and store these in the results folder.
